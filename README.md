## Roshan Bellary's website(roshanbellary.github.io)

Hi! My name is Roshan, and this is the code for my personal website. I'm currently using github pages for hosting my website. I plan to host a blog for interesting topics in cs, math and physics that I encounter during my remaining time in high school. Thanks for reading and visiting!
