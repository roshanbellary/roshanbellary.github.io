Although my interest in math was originally purely based on flexing\n            my knowledge of the quadratic formula on friends ;), I've been transitioning to more research and proof based\n            mathematics by taking classes in analysis and proofs. I'veattended camps in Number Theory, Combinatorics \n            and Linear Algebra while also taking online courses from MIT on Fourier Transforms and Differential Equations\n            (Two pretty cool topics that are neatly related to Lin Alg). I am currently taking a course in Analysis \n            at Euler Circle which is a program that teaches high school students advanced mathematics. Although I don't plan\n            on pursuing a full career in mathematics, I want to learn more about the wonderful world of math and apply what I've\n            learned to my wanted career in software engineering(Proofs are hella important to CS algorithms).\n        </p>\n        <Footer></Footer>\n    </div>\n    )\n}\nexport default Math;","/Users/roshanb/Documents/GitHub/roshanbellary.github.io/src/Science/Science.js",["44"],"import React from 'react';\nimport './Science.css';\nimport Header from '../Header/Header.js';\nimport Footer from '../Footer/Footer.js';\nclass Science extends React.Component{\n    constructor(props){\n        super(props);\n    }\n    render(){\n        return(\n            <div>\n            <Header></Header>\n            <h1>Science </h1>\n            <p>\n                Computer Science and Physics are two of the main subjects that I have focused on in the sciences.
